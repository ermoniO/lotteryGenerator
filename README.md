# lotteryGenerator

This Lottery Number Generator app is a small demonstration of what's possible when you're really motivated. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies.  We created this app due in part to the fact that it's difficult to find a job in tech as a software developer these days. Companies are hiring senior level developers in the guise of entry-level job postings that require 7 years of experience for nominal pay. I'm not sure if anyone is aware, but we're in the middle of The Great Resignation. This is probably the greatest great since The Great Depression. We can't tell you why any of these things are "Great", but I can tell you that this app could possibly make you GREATLY rich! This is our last ditch effort in finding employment. If this doesn't work, we'll be utilizing our app to generate the winning lottery numbers to win it big and retire from an industry we never actually made it into.
